  ### **Why the CER Directive Matters**

The CER Directive isn't just another regulationâ€”it's a strategic shift.

* **Expanded Scope:** It goes beyond cyber threats (like NIS 2\) to cover a wider range of risks.  
* **Broad Coverage:** It has a wider sectoral scope than other regulations like DORA and has no size-based limits.  
* **Urgent Timelines:** Entities identified in July 2026 will have only 10 months to become compliant, making preparation a top priority.  
* **Strategic Opportunity:** Proactive resilience can drive competitive advantages, uncover operational efficiencies, and foster innovation.

### **What Actions Should You Take Now?**

1. **Consider if you are likely to be a critical entity**  
   * Determine if your organisation is likely to be recognised as a critical entity based on your sector and the potential impact of disruptive events.  
2. **Get familiar with the CER Directive's requirements**  
   * Familiarise yourself with the specific requirements, including risk assessments, resilience plans, incident notification, and mitigation measures.  
3. **Review, refresh, and transform your plan for resilience**  
   * **Identify and Evaluate Your Risks:** Conduct comprehensive assessments to identify potential risks.  
   * **Optimise Your Operating Model:** Ensure your governance structures support a data-driven model that integrates resilience into your enterprise framework.  
   * **Focus on Resilience for What Matters Most:** Determine your core priorities and build resilience around essential services.  
   * **Strengthen Crisis Management:** Evaluate and update your incident and crisis management structures to handle unexpected events effectively.  
   * **Conduct Routine Training and Exercises:** Implement a regular program of training and simulations based on realistic scenarios.  
4. **Stay up-to-date on the CER Directive**  
   * Stay informed about updates to the Directive and assess whether you could serve as a supplier to a critical entity.
