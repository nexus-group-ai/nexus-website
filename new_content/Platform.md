### IRIS

### **IRIS: The Risk Intelligence Platform**

**IRIS (Integrated Risk Intelligence System)** is an AI-powered platform designed to enhance strategic decision-making. It uses advanced machine learning to analyse large volumes of data, providing deep insights and actionable intelligence.

**Key features and applications include:**

* **Proactive Alerting:** Establishing robust mechanisms to alert relevant stakeholders to potential risks as they emerge, utilising real-time data feeds and predictive analytics to identify early warning signs. This includes setting up automated notifications for predefined thresholds and anomalies.

* **Thorough Risk Analysis:** Conducting in-depth analyses of identified risks to understand their potential impact on operations, finances, and reputation, as well as their likelihood of occurrence. This involves quantitative and qualitative assessments, scenario planning, and expert consultations to determine the severity and probability of each risk.

* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Develop and implement effective mitigation strategies, including controls, contingency plans, and resource allocation, to reduce risk impact and likelihood. Generate clear, comprehensive reports on risk status, mitigation efforts, and emerging threats. These tailored reports provide actionable insights for decision-making and ensure transparency. Regular and ad-hoc updates maintain situational awareness.

IRIS can be used across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, energy, and cybersecurity, helping organisations become more proactive and competitive.

### **The 5 Shock Models Framework**

Our framework addresses **five key shock models**: Geopolitical, Economic, Social, Environmental, and Technological. Each of its specialised AI-driven models is designed to improve resilience and governance in a specific area.

## **Quantifying Resilience: Integrating FAIR into All-Hazards Governance**

Our framework is built to address the five key shock models essential for modern resilience and governance: **Geopolitical, Economic, Social, Environmental, and Technological**. We use specialised, AI-driven models to strengthen your resilience and governance in each critical area.

### **What is the FAIR Model?**

The **Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)** Model is the international standard quantitative framework for analysing and quantifying operational and cyber risks in **financial terms**.

FAIR moves beyond subjective "High/Medium/Low" ratings to provide a clear, defensible answer: **How much money could we lose, and how often?**

| Goal | Benefit | Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Quantify** potential loss exposure by analysing specific risk scenarios. | Enables **informed decision-making** about risk management and investment. | The recognised international standard for cyber risk quantification. |

### **The Evolution: From Traditional FAIR to AI-Driven CRQ**

Traditional FAIR is crucial but manual, static, and often quickly outdated. Today, boards and regulators demand **dynamic, continuous data** to support financial risk reporting.

We combine FAIRâ€™s structured methodology with AI-driven automation for **Continuous Risk Quantification (CRQ)**:

| Feature | Traditional FAIR (Manual) | AI-Driven CRQ (Automated) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Risk Model** | Scenario-based, static snapshots. | **Living, financial model of risk.** |
| **Data Source** | Manual workshops and spreadsheets. | **Continuous telemetry** from all security tools. |
| **Value** | Foundational structure for quantification. | **Real-time, board-ready reporting** and measurable risk burndown. |

This evolution ensures your governance is not just compliant, but **continuously defensible.**

### **FAIR & The CER Directive: The Engine for Compliance**

The CER Directive defines **what** must be done (the mandate for all-hazards resilience). **FAIR provides the engine for *how* to measure and manage that risk.**

| Complementary Aspect | CER Directive Requirement | FAIR Solution |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Analytical Rigor** | Mandates a risk-based approach for resilience measures. | **Provides the quantitative standard** to calculate the actual financial risk exposure and justify resilience investments. |
| **Decision-Making** | Requires appropriate and proportionate measures to enhance resilience. | Allows you to **optimise investment** by knowing the cost of risk versus the cost of controls. |
| **All-Hazards Scope** | Requires assessment of all relevant physical and operational risks. | **FAIR is threat-agnostic;** it quantifies physical risks (e.g., floods, sabotage) just as effectively as cyber risk. |
