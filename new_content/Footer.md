You are instructing us to process your personal data as outlined in our contract.

We will:

Upon your request, we will provide you with all information necessary to demonstrate our compliance with this agreement. We will also allow and contribute to audits or inspections by you or an auditor you have hired, but only to the extent that this agreement does not already give you sufficient rights to information and audit as required by the Data Protection Law.

### **Data Transfer**

We will not transfer or authorise the transfer of data to countries outside the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA) without your prior written consent. If data is transferred outside the EU/EEA, we will ensure it is adequately protected by meeting the legal requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR (e.g., through EU-approved standard contractual clauses).
